What This Is
------------

This is a repository filled with exercises and code that I wrote while reading the book Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaram.


Information On Running The Algorithms
--------------------------------------

Large datasets were not included within my repo. This includes and may not be limited to the movielens dataset. Sensitive API keys are also not being contributed to the repo. If you want to run code that uses the APIs that are frequently used throughout this book you will need to substitute your own API keys.
